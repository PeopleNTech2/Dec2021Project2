data structure --> java collections framework / java map framework

array is for small amount of data

array is static --> array has to be predefined
array list is dynamic --> grow dynamically based on need

array list can have multiple data type

list is a linear data structure
array list data is defined in block (with index only)

linked list is better for adding and removing (data manipulation)
linked list data is defined in nodes (with node address/pointers)
linked list can be singly linked or doubly linked

set is not accepting duplication while array list does
